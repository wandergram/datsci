The President (interpretation from Russian): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which she
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to

provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

the Council to document S/1997/434, which contains the
text of a letter dated 5 June 1997 from the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain

the Secretary-General, transmitting the text of the Political

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
