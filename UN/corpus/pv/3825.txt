The situation concerning Western Sahara
The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1997/806, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guinea-
Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (interpretation from Spanish): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1133 (1997).
In order to implement this resolution, the Council
requests the Secretary-General to name a Special
Representative as soon as possible, and calls upon the
parties to cooperate with the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General throughout the implementation of the
settlement plan.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
