The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Sierra Leone, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to

with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37

There being no objection, it is so decided.

draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to

Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
