The question concerning Haiti
The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Haiti, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to

with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

document S/2004/164, which contains the text of a

I should like also to draw the attention of the

which contains the text of a letter dated 29 February

It is my understanding that the Security Council
