Report of the Secretary-General on the request
of Nepal for United Nations assistance in
support of its peace process (S/2010/17)
The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya
(Nepal) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/32, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/17, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the request of Nepal for
United Nations assistance in support of its peace
process. I also wish to draw members’ attention to
document S/2010/25, which contains a letter dated
14 January 2010 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
