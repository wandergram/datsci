The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation in Afghanistan and its implications for
international peace and security (S/2010/127)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ayoob
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/147, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Turkey.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2010/127, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Afghanistan and its implications for international peace
and security.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall now give the floor to those delegations
who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr. Apakan (Turkey): As Turkey is the country
that coordinated the discussion on the draft resolution,
I am pleased to submit the draft resolution to extend
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA). It is our sincere hope that
the Council will reaffirm its unwavering support for
UNAMA by adopting the draft resolution unanimously.
The President (spoke in French): The Council
will now proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution (S/2010/147) before it.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1917 (2010).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Security Council has just unanimously
adopted an important resolution on extending the
mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) for a further 12-month period.
This decision of the Security Council addresses a range
of Afghan problems and enhances the central role
played by the United Nations in coordinating
international efforts to achieve a post-conflict
settlement and social and economic rehabilitation in
Afghanistan.
During the discussions on the resolution, the
Russian delegation was able to ensure that it reflected
the difficult realities in the Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan and the challenges arising therefrom, both
for the Afghan Government and for UNAMA and the
international community as a whole. The resolution
reflects the concern of the Security Council regarding
the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan due
to the growing terrorist activities of the Taliban and
Al-Qaida. We note, in that regard, that there is a
growing link between the terrorists in that country and
drug traffickers.
Particular attention is given in the resolution to
the challenge facing the international community in
S/PV.6290
310-28239
terms of achieving national reconciliation in
Afghanistan. We support the ongoing political and
reconciliation processes there, but it must be
understood that these must not hinder the process of
establishing lasting stability in the country or
contravene Security Council resolutions, including on
the effective implementation of the sanctions regime
against the Taliban and Al-Qaida.
We reiterate that dialogue is possible only with
those who have laid down their arms, recognized the
Government and Constitution of Afghanistan, and
broken their links with Al-Qaida and other terrorist
groups. In particular, concerns persist with regard to
the production and illegal traffic of drugs in the Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan. There is no doubt today that
the Afghan drug trade represents a direct and serious
threat to international peace and security. Therefore,
we must neutralize collectively, and use all available
means to do so.
In this regard, we note with concern the
information in the media about the intention of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in
Afghanistan to cease destroying poppy fields,
including in those territories that have been liberated
from the Taliban.
How can we overcome the Taliban’s military
potential when it continues to obtain financial
resources from the illegal drug trade? We are
absolutely convinced that ISAF and the anti-terrorist
coalition must, on the contrary, continue actively and
decisively to address the drug threat emanating from
Afghanistan and to cooperate with the Afghan
Government on the issue. That is the only way to build
upon what has been achieved militarily. Such an
approach will make a real contribution to the long-term
stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan and the
region. Any attempt to bring the Taliban onboard
would be a grave mistake.
We believe that the resolution and, more
important, an enhanced coordinating role for UNAMA
in Afghanistan, will make a practical contribution to
meeting the current challenges in that country,
including in the anti-drug area.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.
