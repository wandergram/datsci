be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual

which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council‚Äôs prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
