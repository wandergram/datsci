The President: I should like to inform the Council

Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Misic´ (Bosnia

Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took the place reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.

meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document

letter dated 20 September 1995 from the Permanent
Representative of Croatia to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to

before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
