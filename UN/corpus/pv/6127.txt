The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
Report of the Secretary-General on Somalia
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1863
(2009) (S/2009/210)
The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Somalia, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mohamed
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/266, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Members of the
Council also have before them the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia,
document S/2009/210.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam
The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1872 (2009).
I shall now give the floor to the representative of
Uganda, who wishes to make a statement following the
adoption of the resolution.
Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): I would just like to say
that we salute everybody for supporting the British-
sponsored resolution on Somalia, as well as to say that
the African Union would like to see the Council take
even stronger measures against those elements who are
sponsoring rebellion and terrorist activities in Somalia.
Also, the African Union pledges to continue to provide
unequivocal support to the Council so that the problem
of Somalia can at long last come to a speedy end.
My last comment is that the situation in
Mogadishu has been very bad. But I am happy to say
that the Government is now pushing the rebels from
sectors of Mogadishu. We expect that the current trend
of pushing the rebels away from Mogadishu and
towards eventual defeat will continue.
The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
