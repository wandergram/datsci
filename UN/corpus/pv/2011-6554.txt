The President (spoke in French): The Security

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the
presidency of the Council has met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed that
they maintain their well-known positions vis-√†-vis the
item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1986 (2011).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
