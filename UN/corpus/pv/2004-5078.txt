The meeting was called to order at 6.45 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangon√©-
Bi (C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire) took a seat at the Council
table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/892, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Chile, France, Germany,
Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of members to document
S/2004/895, containing the text of a letter dated
10 November 2004 from the representative of the
Gambia addressed to the President of the Security
Council, and to document S/2004/896, containing the
text of a letter dated 9 November 2004 from the
representative of Nigeria addressed to the President of
the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2004/892) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1572 (2004).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We are deeply concerned at the current situation in
C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. We condemn the air raid conducted
against the French peacekeepers. We are also
concerned about the civilian casualties caused by this
conflict. We call upon the various parties to exercise
restraint so as to avoid further escalating the crisis.
China has always supported the peace process in
C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. We have always maintained that the
crisis in that country should be resolved by political
means. We hope that the situation in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire will
be stabilized as soon as possible so that the peace
process can be put back on the right track. We support
the mediation efforts of the African Union, the
Economic Community of West African States and the
Secretary-General. In particular, we appreciate the
efforts of President Mbeki of South Africa. We
sincerely hope that those mediation efforts will yield
positive results at an early date.
In the light of the current serious situation in C√¥te
d‚ÄôIvoire, China, like other members of the Security
Council, favours further Council action. At the same
time, we believe that the objective of such action
should be to encourage the various parties to comply
with the ceasefire and to resume the peace process. On
the basis of that principle, and taking into account the
views of the countries members of the African Union,
we voted in favour of the resolution.
The early achievement of peace and
reconciliation will advance the fundamental interests of
the people of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and will help to stabilize
the region. We urge the various parties in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire
to cooperate with the mediation efforts of the
3
S/PV.5078
international community ‚Äî particularly those of the
African Union ‚Äî and to implement the Linas-
Marcoussis Agreement and the Accra III Agreement as
soon as possible. We hope that the resolution adopted
by the Security Council today will assist in the
attainment of those objectives.
Mr. De La Sabli√®re (France) (spoke in French):
The resolution just adopted unanimously by the
Security Council pursues an essential objective ‚Äî to
promote the political situation that the Council has
endorsed and has always supported: implementation by
all the Ivorian parties of the Linas-Marcoussis
Agreement and compliance with all the commitments
made at Accra in July.
The Security Council has never ceased to
reiterate that there is no military solution to the crisis
in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. There is only a political solution: the
one set out at Linas-Marcoussis and specified at Accra.
For months now, we have noted and deplored the
impasse in the situation owing to the refusal by all the
Ivorian parties to honour their own commitments. The
basic legal text defined at Linas-Marcoussis has not
been adopted; the conditions for eligibility for the
presidency of the Republic have not been revised; the
disarmament process has not been undertaken. Those
impasses are unacceptable.
I must recall that the Council, when it visited
Abidjan in June, recalled solemnly and with great
firmness the statements made in April and May
(S/PRST/2004/412 and S/PRST/2004/417). We should
act today, when C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire is experiencing the
situation that know well, by adopting an immediate
arms embargo and by deciding on a mechanism for
individual sanctions if the commitments made by the
parties have not been honoured by 15 December.
By adopting this resolution, the Council is
demonstrating today that it intends to support the
initiatives of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union by
putting all the weight of the international community
behind the African initiatives.
Re-launching this national reconciliation process
is everyone‚Äôs objective. In C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, France is
committed to helping all Ivorians. We are convinced
that the country must move forward towards the
elections in October 2005. That presupposes that all the
conditions set at Linas-Marcoussis will be met. We are
all working to that end.
Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Today, we are
dealing with the conflict prevailing in one of the key
countries of our continent: C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, a country
described in the past as a symbol of prosperity and
stability in Africa and an important Member of the
United Nations. We therefore have the moral obligation
to contribute to its stability at a moment when the
tension among the parties has reached alarming
proportions.
We very much appreciate the constant efforts that
the Secretary-General, now present here, has made to
bring the parties to the table of dialogue.
We deplore the loss of life that has taken place
since the start of this conflict. My delegation is of the
view that, in such a tense and fragile environment, the
Security Council should opt for a kind of pressure that
will not radicalize the position of one or another party
but that will instead continue to stimulate dialogue.
The main concern at this moment is to find the
appropriate way to calm the tension and to bring the
parties back to the process of the implementation of the
Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements. That
should be the main ‚Äî indeed, the only ‚Äî objective of
the resolution we have just adopted.
My delegation joined the consensus, and we trust
that the resolution will represent a step forward in the
direction of peace and that it will encourage the parties
to resume a frank dialogue, as we in Africa know how
to do.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 7 p.m.
