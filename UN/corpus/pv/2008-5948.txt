The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President (spoke in French): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
August 2008, I should like to take this opportunity to
pay tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. Le Luong Minh, Permanent Representative of Viet
Nam, for his service as President of the Security
Council for the month of July 2008. I am sure I speak
for all members of the Council in expressing deep
appreciation to Ambassador Minh for the great
diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council‚Äôs
business last month.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Sixth report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra
Leone (S/2008/281)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Sierra Leone, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Pemagbi
(Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/512, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations. Members also have before them
document S/2008/281, which contains the sixth report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Integrated Office in Sierra Leone.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1829 (2008).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Sierra Leone.
Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone): The delegation of
the Republic of Sierra Leone wishes to express its
profound appreciation to the Security Council for the
resolution that has just been adopted. We warmly
welcome the resolution, mainly because it marks
another significant phase in the United Nations
experiment in post-conflict peacebuilding, with Sierra
Leone as the laboratory. In particular, the
transformation of the United Nations Integrated Office
in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) into an integrated
peacebuilding outfit, the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL), on
the basis of the achievement of carefully measured
benchmarks is a reassuring indication of the country's
progress in consolidating peace and stability.
Since the armed conflict ended in 2002, Sierra
Leone has conducted two democratic presidential,
parliamentary and local council elections, and has
made considerable efforts to revive the economy, to
recover from the ravages of the war and to relaunch the
country on the path of development. We have not done
those things alone. We thank the United Nations and
our other international community partners, as well as
our bilateral supporters, for their investment in the
efforts to achieve lasting peace, to pursue the ideals of
S/PV.5948
308-44826
democracy and human rights and to lift Sierra Leone
from the bottom of the human development index.
We have made gains, but we are far from having
crossed the bridge. As an example, we need sustained
support to achieve the goals set in the Sierra Leone
Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework, namely, those
related to developing the energy, justice and security
sectors, youth employment and integration, governance
and capacity-building in the public service. It is no
overstatement to suggest that a gap will appear in the
success story of the United Nations in Sierra Leone if
the goals in those priority areas, set by Sierra Leone
and the Peacebuilding Commission, are not fully
accomplished. I assure members that the Government
and the people of Sierra Leone remain firmly
committed to fulfilling their own part of the agreement.
Finally, for Sierra Leone and many countries in a
similar situation and with similar experiences, the
current food and oil crises pose potential risks to peace
and security that the Council can ill afford to ignore.
Already, the crises have stretched our fragile economy
nearly to the limits of its elasticity. We need more help.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.
