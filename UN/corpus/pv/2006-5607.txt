The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General
The President (spoke in Arabic): I welcome the
presence of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.
Kofi Annan, at this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/1011, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations. It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to take a decision on the draft
resolution.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
May I take it that it is the wish of the Security
Council to adopt draft resolution S/2006/1011 by
acclamation?
There being no objection, I declare the draft
resolution adopted by acclamation, as resolution 1733
(2006).
It is so decided.
I shall now make a statement on behalf of the
Council.
Mr. Secretary-General, it gives me great pleasure
to express to Your Excellency, on behalf of all Security
Council members, our profound gratitude for the
dedicated service and commitment you provided to the
United Nations as you discharged your awesome
responsibility under its Charter during your 10-year
tenure as Secretary-General. We should also like to
express our appreciation for the high professional and
personal qualities and moral leadership that you
brought to the United Nations as the world‚Äôs top
diplomat.
We should further like to recall your active and
efficient support to the work of the Council and the
efforts you expended to further its objectives and for
that, Mr. Secretary-General, we express our deep
gratitude.
Ladies and Gentlemen, as we pay a special tribute
to the Secretary-General at the end of his successful
term, it is befitting to reflect in retrospect on the past
decade, one that saw global crises and challenges to the
international community.
The time the Secretary-General spent in office
was a period marked by new and special threats,
challenges and changes in the international arena. As a
global leader with creative vision, Mr. Annan rose
steadfastly to the challenge and contributed to
numerous global efforts to face those threats and
changes.
Mr. Annan guided this international Organization
through the dawn of the new millennium. A remarkable
event that marked that juncture was the adoption by the
Millennium Summit of what came to be known as the
Millennium Development Goals. Those goals set by
Member States immediately became top priorities for
the Secretary-General, who contributed more than any
one else to their realization.
Mr. Annan was at the helm of this international
Organization during the past decade, which coincided,
more or less, with the timespan between the
Organization‚Äôs golden and diamond jubilees. As one
would expect, that period was marked by a great many
reviews, assessments and re-evaluations of the United
Nations. At the organizational level, the decade was
characterized by intensive and considerable attention to
reform in all its aspects. To his great credit, Mr. Annan
led the reform movement with quiet deliberation and
introduced many initiatives aimed at strengthening the
United Nations system and enhancing its capacity to
meet the major challenges of our time.
Mr. Annan received wide recognition for his
dedication to the purposes and principles enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations. His sustained efforts
towards the maintenance of international peace and
security, towards finding lasting solutions to various
complex disputes and conflicts around the globe, and
towards the development of friendly relations among
nations, are just a few examples.
During his tenure as Secretary-General, Mr.
Annan endeavoured relentlessly to solve the economic,
social, cultural and environmental issues facing our
world today. His great concern was to meet the
humanitarian needs of people affected by both natural
and man-made disasters. He contributed significantly
to the promotion and protection of human rights and
S/PV.5607

fundamental freedoms for all, so that peoples of the
world can enjoy living in greater freedom.
In a few days, the current Secretary-General will
pass the baton on to his successor, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon,
who, I am confident, will also perform an exemplary
job and bring bold perspectives, new ideas and critical
and vital initiatives to the United Nations and the
international community. We pledge and commit our
strong support to him, as we have done over the years
to Mr. Annan.
Mr. Secretary-General, we extend to Your
Excellency our warmest wishes for further
advancement, health and prosperity, and wish you the
best of luck as you leave the United Nations and
continue your invaluable contribution to the resolution
of issues of concern to both the Organization and the
global community.
I now give the floor to His Excellency Secretary-
General Mr. Kofi Annan.
The Secretary-General: Mr. President, let me
thank you for those very kind words. And I thank you
also for proposing the resolution that the Council has
just passed, by which, needless to say, I am deeply
honoured.
Barring unforeseen crises in the next nine days ‚Äî
which in this Council, of all places, one should never
rule out ‚Äî today‚Äôs meeting will be my last meeting
with you as Secretary-General. I must thank the
Council, not only for using this meeting to pass such a
generous resolution, but also for making it coincide
with another decision that you are about to adopt,
namely the resolution to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone
(UNIOSIL).
Sierra Leone is definitely one of the success
stories of our work together. But those of us who
remember the anxious days of May 2000 know well
that that was far from being a foregone conclusion. But
today Sierra Leone is an example of what can be
achieved by the United Nations and its Member States
working closely together. The country is stable but still
fragile. It needs our continued help in building
effective State institutions, especially those dealing
with security, human rights, justice, and the preparation
for next year‚Äôs elections, which will be a critical
moment in the consolidation of peace. So, I thank the
Council for agreeing to prolong the United Nations
role in Sierra Leone. And I thank the Council for all the
work it has done for peace and security around the
world.
In my 10 years as Secretary-General, I have quite
often allowed myself to make some critical remarks
about this Council, particularly about its composition. I
still hope that such composition will be modified, since
I am convinced that, with a more democratic and
representative character, the Council will gain even
greater legitimacy, and its authority will be more
widely respected.
I have also occasionally criticized the Council‚Äôs
actions, or, more often, its failure to act. And I have
tried, following the excellent example of the Brahimi
Report, to tell the Council what it needs to know, not
what it wants to hear.
Yet I know that the ‚Äúprimary responsibility for
the maintenance of international peace and security‚Äù,
with which the Charter endows the Council, is not an
easy one to bear. In fact, it is much easier to criticize
the Council from outside than to take decisions in it. In
spite of that, the Council‚Äôs members have generally
listened to me with surprising good grace.
And I must also recognize that the work of the
Council has been greatly strengthened during the 10
years of my service. The mandates it has given us have
been more coherent, more robust when required, and
often matched with something like the necessary
resources required. And its members now follow up on
their decisions with greater vigilance, demanding full
reports from me and my colleagues on the missions
they have mandated, and sometimes going to see for
themselves on the spot how things are going.
The Council has also passed some very important
thematic resolutions ‚Äî I think especially of resolution
1325 (2000) on the role of women in the prevention
and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding ‚Äî and it
is generally much more cognizant of the need to prevent
conflict, rather than wait to react after it occurs.
We have all learned from some bitter experiences
that we cannot afford to uncritically accept a
Government‚Äôs word when it assures us that all is well
in its country, or that it has the situation under control.
We have also learned that the Council needs to be fully
briefed on issues of human rights, since gross
violations of human rights not only occur during
conflict but are often the harbingers of conflict.

There is certainly no room for complacency. As I
said last week, it is painful for me to leave office with
the Middle East in such a fragile and dangerous
condition.
I do fervently hope that we are now at last close
to rescuing the people of Darfur from their agony. The
reports I have received from my envoy in Khartoum,
Mr. Ould Abdallah, encourage me to think we may
tomorrow receive a green light from President Bashir
for a full ceasefire, a renewed effort to bring all parties
into the political process, and deployment of the
proposed hybrid African Union-United Nations force to
protect the population. We will, however, need to see
the document that Mr. Ould Abdallah will bring.
But after so many disappointments, I must say
that I take nothing for granted. What I do know is that
the Council will continue to work, ably helped by my
successor, on these and many other crises. But there is
no cause for despair, either. While change for the worse
is often dramatic, change for the better is generally
incremental. Many conflicts have been peacefully
resolved. Many have been at least brought under
control, with hope for better times on the horizon. And
I believe ‚Äî though this is much harder to prove ‚Äî that
many have been prevented.
At all events, it remains the sacred and exalting
duty of this Organization to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war. It has been my
privilege to share this effort with the Security Council,
both in success and in failure. I now relinquish that
task, with relief but not without regret. And I pray that
the Security Council will have ever greater success in
the future.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
