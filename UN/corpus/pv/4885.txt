The situation in Somalia
Letter dated 4 November 2003 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992)
concerning Somalia addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2003/1035)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Somalia in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hashi
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/1035, which contains the letter dated
4 November 2003 addressed to the President of the
Security Council from the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
751 (1992) concerning Somalia. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2003/1177,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council's prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1519 (2003).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
