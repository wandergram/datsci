The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Croatia in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it was so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Simonovic
