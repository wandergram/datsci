Security Council 3915th meeting
Fifty-third year 13 August 1998
The meeting was called to order at 5.10 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Threats to peace and security caused by international
terrorist acts
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of the
United Republic of Tanzania, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Manongi
(United Republic of Tanzania) took a seat at the
Council table.
Expression of sympathy to the Governments and people
of Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and the
United States in connection with the bombings of the
United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
The President: I should like, on behalf of the Security
Council, to express deep sympathy to the Governments and
people of Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and the
United States of America in connection with the great
tragedy they suffered as a result of the bombings of the
United States of America embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-
Salaam on 7 August 1998, in which several United Nations
staff members were also injured. The members of the
Council condemn the terrorist acts against innocent civilians
and request the representatives of Kenya, the United
Republic of Tanzania and the United States of America to
convey to their Governments and people, and to the
bereaved families, their profound condolences. The
members of the Council express the hope that the injured
will make a rapid and full recovery.
I request the members of the Council to stand and
observe a minute of silence in memory of those who so
tragically lost their lives.
The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1998/748, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to vote on the draft resolution (S/1998/748) before
it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bahrain, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, France, Gabon,
Gambia, Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Russian Federation,
Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1189 (1998).
I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Kenya.
Mrs. Odera (Kenya): My delegation welcomes this
opportunity to express its outrage and condemnation of
the criminal and unjustified terrorists bombings which
occurred almost simultaneously in Nairobi and Dar-es-
Salaam on 7 August 1998. Terrorist acts are by design
ruthlessly indiscriminate, and the bomb blast in Nairobi,
which occurred at one of the busiest locations in terms of
human traffic and commercial activities, was no
exception. It has so far claimed over 250 lives, and the
death toll continues to rise. Many are either in critical
condition in hospital or unaccounted for. Over 300 are
still hospitalized, while some 4,500 innocent civilians
have been treated for injuries suffered from the blast.

Security Council 3915th meeting
Fifty-third year 13 August 1998
The bombs caused damage estimated at over $500
million to property. One seven-storey building was
completely destroyed. Several others within the vicinity
suffered extensive damage. A total of 67 buildings received
collateral damage.
Nothing can be more brutal and horrifying than this
act which wiped out an entire classroom of students who
were waiting for their final exams. This is what the
perpetrators of this despicable crime did when they blew up
and flattened Ufundi Cooperative House.
The bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam brought
mayhem and terror of an untold magnitude to two countries
that had hitherto considered themselves secure and far
removed from threats and dangers posed by acts of
terrorism. Alas, we were wrong. The two incidents make it
abundantly clear that nobody is safe from or unaffected by
this heinous practice. The extension of these activities to
our otherwise peaceful countries exemplifies the expanding
reach and growing menace of the perpetrators of terrorist
acts.
Today's meeting of the Council, which has been
convened in response to the two terrorist bombings, is a
demonstration by the international community that such acts
‚Äî regardless of whom they are directed at, wherever and
by whomever they are committed ‚Äî cannot be tolerated.
The resolution just adopted is a resounding statement of
condemnation and abhorrence of acts carried out against
innocent people. The Government of the Republic of
Kenya, on its part, will not rest until those responsible are
convicted. We appeal to Member States to cooperate with
the ongoing investigations, in Kenya and Tanzania and
outside, aimed at bringing the culprits to justice.
Finally, let me take this opportunity on behalf of the
Government of Kenya to express gratitude for the generous
assistance and support promptly made available in the
rescue efforts by Governments, international organizations
and volunteers who came from far and wide.
The President: The next speaker is the representative
of the United Republic of Tanzania, to whom I give the
floor.
Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): The
United Republic of Tanzania addresses the Security
Council at a time when our country is still stricken by
shock and grief following a terrorist attack which resulted
in loss of life and damage to property.
The resolution adopted by the Security Council
today is a confirmation of the fact that the international
community is united in its unequivocal condemnation of
the scourge of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations.
Being the recent victims of these dastardly terrorist
attacks, Kenya and Tanzania have been painfully exposed
to the horrors of this heinous crime. President Benjamin
William Mkapa has committed all our national efforts to
confronting this evil and expressed our firm resolve to
apprehend those responsible and to bring them to justice.
In this regard, the Government has made an appeal to the
international community to come to its assistance for the
purposes of carrying out successful investigations and
prosecution. We are therefore gratified to note that the
resolution adopted underscores this aspect as well.
The United Republic of Tanzania continues to
condemn terrorist activities in all their forms and
manifestations, whether perpetrated by individual groups
or by States, irrespective of the motivation involved. The
recent barbaric attack has not weakened, but rather
strengthened, this resolve.
In conclusion, I wish first to reiterate the sympathies
of my Government to the injured and to the bereaved
families, both in Kenya and in the United States of
America. As we mourn for our people, we mourn also for
the people of Kenya and the United States. Secondly, I
wish to reassure the Council of the utmost concern of my
Government regarding the security of diplomatic missions
and their personnel in our country. Lastly, I should also
record the appreciation of my Government for the
messages of sympathy and condolence we have received
and continue to receive. Those expressions have been and
continue to be a source of considerable encouragement for
which we are immensely thankful.
Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): On this
sorrowful occasion, the United States is honoured to join
with the Governments of Kenya and the United Republic
of Tanzania in introducing this resolution on the tragic
and indiscriminate terrorist bombings at the American
embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. President
Clinton and Secretary Albright have conveyed the
3
Security Council 3915th meeting
Fifty-third year 13 August 1998
condolences of the people of the United States to the
families and loved ones of the hundreds who lost their lives
and the thousands who were injured in both Kenya and
Tanzania in these cowardly terrorist acts. To the
Governments of Kenya and the United Republic of
Tanzania, we have offered the support of the United States
in dealing with this tragedy, meeting their needs and
working jointly and cooperatively with them to find the
perpetrators.
The incidents of 7 August underscore that terrorists
know no boundaries and that the suppression of
international terrorism and the arrest, conviction and
punishment of its perpetrators are essential to the
maintenance of international peace and security.
The United States will not be intimidated by
terrorism and will never forget its victims. We will spare
no effort and use all the means at our disposal to track
down and punish the perpetrators of these outrageous
acts. We call upon all Member States to support the
ongoing investigations and to apprehend the perpetrators
if found on their territory, as called for in the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against
Internationally Protected Persons.
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.
