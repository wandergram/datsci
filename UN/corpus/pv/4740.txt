The meeting was called to order at 12.35 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on his mission
of good offices in Cyprus (S/2003/398)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus (S/2003/398). Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2003/418,
which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted
by Bulgaria, France, Germany, Spain, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1475 (2003).
I now call on the representative of the Russian
Federation, who wishes to make a statement following
the voting.
Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently
favoured the achievement of a just settlement of the
problem of Cyprus. We believe that that problem must
be resolved through the establishment of a single
bicommunal, bizonal federal State that ensures full
political equality for both communities inhabiting the
island, as provided for by the relevant Security Council
resolutions, particularly resolution 1250 (1999).
We support the efforts of the Secretary-General
and his Special Adviser on Cyprus within the
framework of the good offices mission. The outcome of
that mission was the “Annan plan”, whose basic
parameters are balanced in nature. As stated in
resolution 1475 (2003), just adopted by the Security
Council, we call upon the parties to continue the
negotiating process to reach a peaceful settlement,
using the Annan plan’s basic parameters as a basis for
dialogue. Taking into account the well-known concerns
of both sides regarding individual elements of the plan,
we believe that it will be possible to adjust it, which
would help in reaching compromise solutions. On that
basis, the Russian Federation supported Security
Council resolution 1475 (2003), on Cyprus.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.
