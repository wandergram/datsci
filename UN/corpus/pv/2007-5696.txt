The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior

capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-√†-vis the item on the Council ‚Äòs agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent
of the members of the Council, I have drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a

If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
