The meeting was called to order at 12.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Disengagement Observer
Force (S/2004/948)
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/948, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2004/963,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1578 (2004).
In connection with the resolution just adopted on
the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, I have been authorized
to make the following complementary statement on
behalf of the Security Council:
“As is known, the report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (S/2004/948) states in paragraph
12: ‘... the situation in the Middle East is very
tense and is likely to remain so, unless and until a
comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of
the Middle East problem can be reached’. That
statement of the Secretary-General reflects the
view of the Security Council.”
This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2004/47.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
