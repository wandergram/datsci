Agenda
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
2 13-23352
S/PV.6920
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I shall be
brief. First, I should like to inform the members of the
Security Council that the Sudan has cooperated with
the sanctions Committee and the Panel of Experts since
they were created in 2005. The Sudan intends to pursue
that cooperation, but we note that if any member of the
Panel of Experts should become involve in any activity
that threatens our national security, we shall be entitled
to refuse to cooperate with that member, who will need
to be replaced by someone who will work in accordance
with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
In resolution 2091 (2013), just adopted, the Security
Council expresses its concern that the direct or indirect
supply, sale or transfer to the Sudan of technical
assistance and support, including training, financial
or other assistance and the provision of spare parts,
weapons systems and related materiel, could be used
by the Government of the Sudan to support military
aircraft being used in violation of resolutions 1556
(2005) and 1591 (2005). This concern is based on false
premises, since the Sudan uses its aircraft for purely
peaceful, civilian purposes.
The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
