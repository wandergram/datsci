The meeting was called to order at 4.55 p.m.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President (spoke in Arabic): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
December, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. John Danforth, Permanent Representative of the
United States to the United Nations, for his service as
President of the Security Council for the month of
November 2004. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Council in expressing our deep appreciation to
Ambassador Danforth for the great diplomatic skill
with which he conducted the Council’s business last
month, in particular during our meetings in Nairobi.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Burundi
Second report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations Operation in Burundi
(S/2004/902)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nkingiye
(Burundi), took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on Burundi, contained
in document S/2004/902. Members of the Council also
have before them document S/2004/930, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the
course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1577 (2004).
Mr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):
The resolution that we have just unanimously adopted
extends the mandate of the United Nations Operation
in Burundi (ONUB) for six months. It also sends an
important message to the Burundian parties, in
particular to the Forces nationales de libération of
Agathon Rwasa.
The resolution gives the Security Council an
opportunity to respond to the joint report of ONUB, the
United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights on the massacre that took place in
Gatumba on 13 August 2004. In its presidential
statement of 15 August 2004, our Council firmly
condemned that crime and asked that the perpetrators
be promptly brought to justice.
In accordance with the recommendation of the
joint report of the United Nations, Burundi has
announced that it will refer the Gatumba incident to the
ICC. We welcome that decision. We also welcome the
fact that the resolution expresses the Security Council’s
support for the efforts of United Nations Members to
put an end to impunity, including the efforts
undertaken by States in cooperation with the relevant
international organizations and, in particular, with the
International Criminal Court. The authorities in
Burundi are making significant efforts with regard to
the inquiry into the Gatumba massacre. They deserve
the international assistance they have asked for,
including that of the ICC. It is proper that the Council
encourage all regional Governments and parties
concerned to cooperate actively with those efforts.

S/PV.5093
Mr. Danforth (United States of America): At the
outset, let me congratulate you, Mr. President, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Council. This is a
very substantial upgrade. I wish you well in the coming
month and thank you for your very kind words
addressed to me.
The resolution that the Security Council has
adopted today is important in many respects. First, it
extends the United Nations mission in Burundi,
showing that we, as Member States of the United
Nations, are in this process for the long haul. Secondly,
the resolution forcefully condemns the violence that
continues to plague Burundi, particularly the Gatumba
massacre. It also states that those responsible for that
violence must be brought to justice. Thirdly, it
recognizes the important contributions made by other
African nations — including Uganda, South Africa and
the United Republic of Tanzania — to bring peace and
stability to that troubled region. This is a
comprehensive and forceful resolution.
Some of my colleagues have expressed concern
that the resolution lacks language concerning the
precise forum in which the perpetrators of violence in
Burundi may be brought to justice. The United States
strongly encourages Burundi to take further steps to
establish its truth and reconciliation commission, as
agreed to by signatories to the Arusha accords, as an
important step towards ending impunity.
Moreover, I would like to reiterate that it is the
policy of the Government of the United States to
ensure that United States persons, including members
of the armed forces of the United States of America
participating in United States peace operations, are
protected from criminal prosecutions or other assertion
of jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court
(ICC), including through the inclusion of express
provisions providing such protection. United States
persons are not participating in the United Nations
Operation in Burundi (ONUB). Consequently we do
not believe such express provisions are necessary in
this case. In addition, consistent with the statement that
the United States made upon the adoption of General
Assembly resolution 58/318, expenses resulting from
the provision of any cooperation or support to the ICC
would be on a reimbursable basis. In this particular
case the United States supports the resolution based on
the understanding that it in no way directs, encourages
or authorizes ONUB to cooperate with or support the
ICC. Moreover, the United States supports the
resolution based on the understanding that it does not
change the existing mandate of ONUB regarding the
investigation of violations of humanitarian law.
I would like to make a simple request of the
Security Council and of other United Nations Member
States. Let us put aside our differences on the ICC and
focus on the positive result we have achieved here
today in the specific context of the ongoing United
Nations peacekeeping operation in Burundi. It is a
good day for Burundi and for the prospects of peace
and national reconciliation there. It is a good day for
the United Nations in reaffirming its role in that effort.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of the United States for his kind words
addressed to me.
Mr. Pleuger (Germany): My delegation would
like to welcome your presence in the Chair,
Mr. President. We pledge to you our full support during
the month of December. We would also like to thank
Ambassador Danforth for the able manner in which
conducted the business of the Council last month.
The resolution we have just adopted does not
only extend the mandate of the United Nations
Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for another six months;
it also contains important messages to the Burundian
parties, most prominently to Mr. Agathon Rwasa’s
Forces de liberation (Palipehutu-FNL). The resolution
is the first reaction of the Council to the joint report by
ONUB, the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the Gatumba massacre
of 13 August 2004. Unfortunately, the Gatumba
massacre is not the only case of atrocities committed
during the more-than-a-decade-long conflict in
Burundi. Burundi’s recent history is also a history of
widespread human rights violations, as well as one of
impunity. To achieve peace, that cycle has to be
broken.
The fight against impunity for grave violations of
human rights and international humanitarian law is a
matter of the utmost concern, and it needs to be
addressed as a matter of priority by Burundi and other
States in the Great Lakes region. The Burundian justice
system therefore desperately needs our political and
material support. The fight against impunity in Burundi
and in other States with scarce capacity in the
administration of justice can be won only with
4
S/PV.5093
international support. We welcome the intention of the
Government of Burundi, expressed in its statement
dated 29 October 2004 (S/2004/867), to refer the
matter of the Gatumba massacre to the International
Criminal Court (ICC) following its own internal
investigations. One of the recommendations of the
United Nations report on Gatumba, to which I have
referred, is indeed to encourage the Government of
Burundi to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction.
We particularly welcome the support of the
Security Council, as expressed in the resolution, for the
efforts being made by States to end impunity. In
addition to national efforts, that includes the efforts
being made by States in cooperation with international
institutions and tribunals, notably the International
Criminal Court. We know that there are different views
within the Council with regard to the ICC. We do not
seek to impose our views on others. But the
Government of Burundi is making a significant effort
to investigate the massacre in the Gatumba refugee
camp, including through its decision to refer the case to
the ICC. It is right that the Council should encourage
all regional Governments and parties concerned to
actively cooperate with those efforts.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of the Germany for his kind words
addressed to me.
Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I
would like to join colleagues is thanking Ambassador
Danforth for his stewardship of the Council in
November. I would also like to wish you every success,
Mr. President, during your presidency in December.
You will have the full support of the delegation of the
United Kingdom.
The resolution we have adopted today not only
extends the mandate of the United Nations Operation
in Burundi (ONUB) for another six months, it also
contains important messages to the Burundian parties
and, most prominently, to the Forces national de
liberation (Palipehutu-FNL). The resolution is the first
reaction of the Council to the Gatumba massacre,
which unfortunately is not the only case of atrocities
committed during the more-than-a-decade-long conflict
in Burundi. That recent history is also a record of
widespread human rights violations, as well as one of
impunity. To achieve peace, that cycle has to be
broken.
The fight against impunity for grave violations of
human rights and international humanitarian law is a
matter of the utmost concern, and it needs to be
addressed as a matter of priority by Burundi and by
other States in the Great Lakes region. The Burundian
justice system therefore desperately needs our political
and material support, if the fight against impunity is to
be won.
We welcome the intention of the Government of
Burundi, expressed by what it said in its statement, to
refer the matter of the massacre to the International
Criminal Court (ICC) following its own internal
investigation. One of the recommendations of the
United Nations report on Gatumba is indeed to
encourage the Government of Burundi to invoke the
jurisdiction of the ICC.
The United Kingdom particularly welcomes the
support that the Council has now expressed in this
resolution for efforts which States are making, aimed at
ending impunity, as well as national efforts. That
includes efforts which States are making in cooperation
with international institutions and tribunals, notably the
International Criminal Court.
There are different views within the Council on
the ICC. We are not seeking to impose our views on
others, but the Government of Burundi is making a
significant effort to investigate the massacre in the
Gatumba refugee camp, including through its key
decision to refer the case to the ICC. It is right,
therefore, that the Council should encourage all
Governments and parties concerned in the region
actively to cooperate with those efforts.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of the United Kingdom for the kind
words he addressed to the presidency.
Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
I too would like to thank Ambassador Danforth and the
entire delegation of the United States of America for
the remarkable role they played in the presidency of
the Council during the month of November. I would
like also to say, Sir, how pleased we are to be working
under your able leadership. We can ensure you of our
full cooperation throughout the month of December,
which will be Spain’s final month as an elected
member of the Security Council.
Security Council resolution 1577 (2004), which
we have just unanimously adopted, not only extends
5
S/PV.5093
the mandate of the United Nations Operation in
Burundi (ONUB) for an additional six-month period. It
is a resolution that also contains important political
messages for the Burundian parties, in particular with
respect to the cessation of violence and to the peace
process. Those messages are directed to all parties, but
in particular to the Forces nationales de libération
(Palipehutu-FNL).
The resolution is the first reaction by the Security
Council since it received the joint report of the United
Nations Operation in Burundi, THE United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUC) and the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
regarding the massacre that took place in the Gatumba
refugee camp on 13 August 2004.
Unfortunately, the Gatumba massacre was not the
only case of atrocities committed during the long
conflict in Burundi, which has lasted more than a
decade. Burundi’s recent history is a history that has
included widespread human rights violations, most of
which also, unfortunately, have been committed with
impunity. If we want peace to be achieved in Burundi,
that cycle has to be broken. The fight against impunity
for the most serious violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law is a matter of particular
concern for all of us and must be properly addressed,
as a priority, by Burundi and by the other States of the
Great Lakes region.
It is clear that the Burundian justice system needs
political and material support from the international
community. The fight against impunity in Burundi and
other States that have limited capacities in that area can
be won only with effective international support. We
welcome the intention of the Government of Burundi,
as expressed in its letter of 29 October 2004
(S/2004/867), to refer the matter to the International
Criminal Court (ICC) following its own national
investigations.
One of the recommendations of the joint United
Nations report on the Gatumba massacre is indeed to
encourage the Government of Burundi to invoke, at the
proper time, the Court’s jurisdiction in this case. Spain
welcomes the support of the Security Council, as
expressed in resolution 1577 (2004), which we have
just adopted, for the efforts that are being made by
States to end impunity in the region. In addition to
national efforts, these also include efforts being made
by States in cooperation with international institutions
and tribunals, and specifically with the International
Criminal Court.
The Government of Burundi is making a
significant effort to investigate the massacre in the
Gatumba refugee camp, including its stated willingness
to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court
at the proper time. It is thus perfectly appropriate for
the Security Council to encourage regional
Governments and other parties concerned to cooperate
actively with those efforts.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Spain for the kind words he addressed
to the presidency.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.
