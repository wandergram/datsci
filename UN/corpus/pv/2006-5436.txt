The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Timor-Leste, in which she
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council‚Äôs prior consultations.

President of Timor-Leste.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed on the vote on the draft resolution
