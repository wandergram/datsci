Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The question concerning Haiti
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(S/2006/60)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Haiti, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mérorès
(Haiti) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/60, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/2006/97, which contains the
text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council’s prior consultations.
I should like to inform members that changes
have been made to the fourth preambular paragraph of
the draft resolution. Accordingly, the fourth
preambular paragraph reads as follows:
“Welcoming the progress achieved thus far
in Haiti’s political process and urging all Haitians
to continue to participate in it and to accept
peacefully its outcome”.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution, as orally
revised. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution, as orally revised, has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1658 (2006).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
