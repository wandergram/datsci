The situation in Somalia
Letter dated 21 November 2006 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992)
concerning Somalia addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2006/913)
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Somalia in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mohamed
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2006/913, containing a letter
dated 21 November 2006 from the Chairman of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia transmitting
the report on the Monitoring Group on Somalia.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/921, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Qatar.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1724 (2006).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
With this meeting, I have concluded my
responsibilities as President of the Security Council for
the month of November 2006. I would like to thank all
members of the Council for the cooperation that I have
received. It has been a professionally interesting
experience for me and an important one for my
country. I hope that I can continue to contribute to the
work of the Council in 2007.
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
