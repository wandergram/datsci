standing relations characterized by reciprocal esteem
and respect. Since my country attained to international
sovereignty, India has always stood at our side in the
defence of our territorial integrity. I take this opportunity
to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Gert
Rosenthal, Permanent Representative of Guatemala,
and to thank him for his outstanding leadership of of
the Council last month.
I also thank you, Sir, for having agreed to convene
this important meeting of the Security Council
on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, particularly in the light of the humanitarian
tragedy currently unfolding in and around Goma as a
consequence of the aggression by regular troops of the
Rwandan army.
Let me furthermore pay well-deserved tribute to
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his good offices
and his commitment to the quest for peace and security
around the world in general, and in particular for his
personal involvement in restoring lasting peace to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The accelerating deterioration of the situation in
the province of North Kivu began on 15 November
following the attacks launched on positions of the
Forces armées de la République démocratique du
Congo (FARDC) by troops of the regular Rwandan
army. These included three battalions of the Rwandan
Defence Forces (RDF), commanded by General
Ruvusha, and two RDF special forces units, including
a heavy artillery unit commanded by Rwandan General
Gatama Kashumba.
In the view of many observers on the ground,
the so-called military success of the 23 March
Movement (M-23) in Goma was rather suprising. Unlike
the debacle suffered by the attackers since 15 November
in the areas of Kibumba and Kazizi along the border
with Rwanda, the operations that led to the fall of
Goma benefited from remarkable planning, abundant
resupply, and in particular night-vision equipment. This
is materiel that, unlike Rwanda, neither the FARDC nor
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO)
have in their arsenals. Even air defence equipment was
used against combat helicopters of the Forces armées de
la République démocratique du Congo and MONUSCO.
Rwandan territory has been used systematically as a
theatre for manoeuvres to circumvent the Forces armées
The meeting was called to order at 7.50 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning the Democratic Republic
of the Congo
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and Rwanda to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/858, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Colombia, France, Germany, Morocco,
Portugal, South Africa, Togo, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2076 (2012).
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Mr. Ngwej (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
(spoke in French): It is an honour for me to address
the Security Council on behalf of Mr. Joseph Kabila
Kabange, President of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, whom I am representing at this meeting,
and on behalf of the entire Congolese people and its
Government.
At the outset, I express my deep pleasure in seeing
you, Sir, presiding over the Security Council this
month. You represent India, a country with which the
Democratic Republic of the Congo maintains long-

de la République démocratique du Congo in order to
conquer new territory on the road to Goma.
There is no need for us at this juncture to go into
detail about other evidence of Rwanda’s involvement
in the war around Goma. There is a great deal of such
evidence, and it is well documented. In that respect,
how can we describe this humanitarian tragedy without
concluding that the situation has only exacerbated
human suffering, the loss of human life, massive
violations of human rights, the rape of women, the
forced recruitment of children, widespread population
displacements, extortion of property, the breakdown of
economic and trade activity, and the growing number
of Congolese refugees. In brief, the situation is one of
widespread insecurity and a major humanitarian crisis.
We hereby request the Security Council to reaffirm
and uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter
of the United Nations, of which it is the guarantor, and
particularly to most firmly condemn Rwanda and the
assaults on human rights and international humanitarian
law perpetrared by its troops on Congolese territory. The
Council must demand that Rwanda put an immediate
end to its aggression and withdraw all its troops from
the city of Goma and the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. It must insist on a cessation of
all forms of violence and activity that could destabilize
and undermine the authority of the Congolese State. It
must support the efforts of the Government to restore
and strengthen State authority in the eastern part of
the country, and implement targeted sanctions against
all leaders of M-23 and Rwandan officers cited in the
mid-term report of the United Nations group of experts.
In order to dissipate the climate of instability
prevailing in the province of North Kivu, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo calls for open dialogue in good
faith with Rwanda in order to resolve their ongoing
security problems. We also call for the good offices of
the United Nations to facilitate that dialogue.
Furthermore, we would like to see greater
involvement on the part of MONUSCO in terms of
resources, force strength and logistics, so as to meet
more effectively the demands of peacekeeping in the
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Now that the responsibility of Rwanda has
been clearly established in the destabilization of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in mass human rights
violations and in the humanitarian tragedy afflicting
the people of North Kivu, it is up to the Council to
take the following action. First, in the light of the acts
committed by Rwanda, it should state that the recurring
attitude of this neighbouring country with regard to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo constitutes a serious
and persistent violation of the principles enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations in its Articles 1, 2,
6 and 39; a serious threat to international peace and
security in the subregion; and a series of proven acts of
aggression under Article 39 of the Charter.
Secondly, it should state that once again Rwanda
has circumvented the sacrosanct principle enshrined
in paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter, which calls
on States Members of the Organization to refrain in
their international relations from resorting to the threat
or the use of force against the territorial integrity or
political independence of any State, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United
Nations.
Thirdly, the Council should state that Rwanda is
a Member of the United Nations and recall that, in
accordance with Article 6 of the Charter, a Member
that persistently violates the principles of the Charter
may be expelled from the Organization by the General
Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security
Council.
Lastly, the Council should ascertain all the
consquences of Rwanda’s behaviour and take whatever
steps are necessary to restore peace and security in
North Kivu.
In conclusion, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo reiterates its openness to dialogue with the true
protagonist, Rwanda. Nevertheless, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo will no longer settle for easy
arrangements of the sort that, for three years, have always
produced the same effects with the same consequences.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo now demands
an open, frank debate that could guarantee lasting
peace in the interests of all the peoples of the region.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Rwanda.
Mr. Nduhungirehe (Rwanda) (spoke in French):
I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council.
Rwanda had planned to speak tomorrow during
the debate on the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Sanctions Committee, but the adoption of resolution
2076 (2012) this evening and the statement just made
4 12-59700
S/PV.6866
by the representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo have forced us to take the floor now.
Let us recall events. The ceasefire decided upon
at the International Conference on the Great Lakes
Region (ICGLR) had held for three months when it was
brought to an end by attacks that Rwanda immediately
condemned. We condemned the resumption of fighting
and asked both parties to cease hostilities and respect
the decisions of the ICGLR.
Several times since the fighting resumed, Rwanda
has suffered rocket and mortar attacks originating in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those attacks
resulted in two deaths and more than seven injured. We
raised those incidents with our Congolese colleagues,
and the first reaction from the Forces armées de la
République démocratique du Congo was to accept and
acknowledge that shots had been fired from Congolese
territory, to apologize and to promise that it would not
happen again. That was the first reaction. Subsequently,
we read newspaper reports that the spokesperson of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo Government had
said that the attacks of mortar fire from that country
had not taken place and that Rwanda was firing on its
own population to justify intervention. That was the
second version. Then the third version, which we read
in the letter submitted by the Permanent Representative
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is that it was
Rwanda that fired mortar shots into the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. We would therefore now like
to ask the Security Council to condemn those attacks
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo against a
State that is not a party to the conflict.
This very day, Rwanda, together with our friends
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is
participating in an ICGLR meeting in Kampala in an
attempt to resolve the situation. Rwandan President Paul
Kagame, President Kabila of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo and Ugandan President Museveni will
meet tomorrow to discuss the situation. If we have
learned one thing during this war and the fall of Goma it
is that so-called military solutions are failures. Military
solutions will not work. What is needed is dialogue, but
not a dialogue between the wrong people. The dialogue
needs to be among the Congolese parties — among
those who are fighting in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. Our position is therefore that it is high
time for the two parties to sit down at a table to have
a dialogue and find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
We would like to draw the attention of the
international community to the fact that decisions
leading to sanctions are counterproductive on the
ground. We therefore appeal to the Security Council and
other international actors to work for further dialogue
so that we can bring to an end once and for all the war
raging in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, as it is also having effects on our country.
Rwanda stands ready to participate in that effort in the
context of the ICGLR, as well as to cooperate with the
agencies of the United Nations to assist refugees and
other persons in distress.
Rwanda refutes the accusations of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and calls for dialogue as the only
route that could lead to a lasting solution to the conflict.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 8.10 p.m.
