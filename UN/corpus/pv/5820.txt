The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Fifteenth progress report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Operation in
Côte d’Ivoire (S/2008/1)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bailly-Niagri
(Côte d’Ivoire) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/15, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2008/1, which contains the fifteenth
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South

The President (spoke in Arabic): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1795 (2008).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
