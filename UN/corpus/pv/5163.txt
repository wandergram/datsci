The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like

in the consideration of the item on the Council’s

provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
