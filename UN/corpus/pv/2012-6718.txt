The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
Special report of the Secretary-General on
Somalia (S/2012/74)
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the special report of the Secretary-
General on Somalia, which has been issued as
document S/2012/74.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/104, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 2036 (2012).
I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom sponsored resolution 2036 (2012)
because the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM) needs the right support to help it work with
the Somali security forces to secure a more stable and
peaceful Somalia. The resolution gives AMISOM the
troops and resources necessary to enable it to
effectively capitalize on the gains already made and to
increase the military pressure on Al-Shabaab.
I am grateful for colleagues‚Äô support during the
negotiations on the resolution. It marks an important
step in advance of the London conference on Somalia
tomorrow, which will look at the wider international
approach to Somalia.
The Council‚Äôs decision today was informed by a
joint United Nations-African Union planning on
AMISOM in a technical assessment mission, the
development of an African Union-AMISOM strategic
concept and the Secretary-General‚Äôs special report
(S/2012/74) on AMISOM. The AMISOM strategic
concept and the Secretary-General‚Äôs report gave the
Council a clear view on what AMISOM needed to
make progress in Somalia.
AMISOM needed troop levels to increase to
17,731, and it needed more sustainable and predictable
funding. The resolution adopted today gives AMISOM
those tools, increasing troop numbers to the required
level and increasing funding for the AMISOM
operation from the United Nations logistical package.
The resolution also gives AMISOM a clearer mandate
to operate, promoting effective regional coordination
and cooperation and stressing the importance of the
development of effective Somali security forces. That
is important to ensure that military action in Somalia is
undertaken carefully and contributes to the wider
political strategy for Somalia.
An expanded and better resourced AMISOM will
help increase areas of stability in Somalia. It will help
the political process in Somalia by enabling Somalis
outside the capital to take part in the political and
constitutional process, making that process more
representative and legitimate. Expanding AMISOM to
areas beyond Mogadishu will increase the pressure on
Al-Shabaab and further decrease the space available
to it.
Capacity-building needs to be at the heart of the
relationship between the United Nations and the
African Union (AU) and its subregional organizations.
That will help those organizations to deliver the
responsibilities they have assumed for peace and
security on the continent and to build on the progress
made in developing the African peace and security
architecture. We encourage the cooperation and
coordination between the AU and the United Nations
on AMISOM to continue and to develop in the future.
The United Kingdom recognizes the important
role that regional organizations can play in the pursuit
S/PV.6718
312-23786
of peace and security in Africa and elsewhere.
AMISOM‚Äôs success demonstrates that. The resolution
adopted today provides AMISOM with the support it
needs and deserves.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States is pleased to have voted in favour of resolution
2036 (2012). The Transitional Federal Government of
Somalia (TFG) and the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM) need to work together in fighting
Al-Shabaab. This resolution supports that goal. The
expansion of the AMISOM troop contingent and the
accompanying growth of the logistical support package
administered by the United Nations Support Office for
AMISOM could make a decisive difference in
weakening terrorism and bringing peace. In the short
term, we hope that the strengthened United Nations
commitment will help to make tomorrow‚Äôs London
conference on Somalia a success.
The United States will continue its strong
bilateral support for AMISOM troop-contributing
countries, which to date has totalled over $338 million.
We urge other Member States to also provide
assistance. We call on new donors to play a part in the
effort to support the TFG‚Äôs national security forces,
which urgently require assistance. We look forward to
a strong, continuing conversation in the Council and
between the Security Council and the African Union
(AU) on AMISOM‚Äôs progress, needs and challenges.
We will continue to monitor how best to support
AMISOM in the months to come.
We regret that the Council did not include support
for maritime assets for AMISOM at this stage. We
consider maritime assets to be valuable in achieving
AMISOM‚Äôs overall security objectives, and we hope
that the Council will revisit that discussion in the
coming months.
With today‚Äôs resolution, the Security Council is
demonstrating its backing for an African-led regional
security initiative. We commend the Governments of
Burundi and Uganda for their commitment, and we
welcome Djibouti‚Äôs initial deployment. We urge all
countries contributing troops to AMISOM to adhere to
prescribed command-and-control arrangements. We
also welcome today‚Äôs decision to incorporate Kenyan
military efforts into AMISOM‚Äôs strategic objectives
and mandate. We urge other African Union partners to
contribute troops as soon as possible to help AMISOM
reach a strength of 17,731 uniformed personnel and to
capitalize on AMISOM‚Äôs historic successes against
Al-Shabaab.
Of course, the situation in Somalia cannot be
resolved by military force alone. The Transitional
Federal Government must seize the opportunity
provided by AMISOM and the Somali national security
forces. It must complete the tasks laid out in the
Kampala Accord, the road map to end the transition in
Somalia and the Garowe Principles. There must be no
extension of the TFG‚Äôs mandate beyond 20 August.
The time for political progress is now.
At the request of the TFG, the Security Council
has taken important steps today to further degrade
Al-Shabaab by cutting off one of its primary revenue
streams ‚Äî charcoal exports. The charcoal ban will also
reduce a serious environmental threat that impacts food
security in Somalia. We urge all Member States to take
rapid, effective steps to meet their responsibilities to
comply with that obligation and to immediately
implement the ban on charcoal.
In concluding, let me emphasize the United States
ongoing commitment to Somalia, to the AU and to
AMISOM. We will continue to work with the
international community to help end the threat of
terrorism to and the suffering of the Somali people.
Mr. Cabral (Portugal): Portugal has always been
supportive of the African Union‚Äôs efforts in Somalia.
Within the European Union, we have consistently
supported the financing requests for the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) through the African
Peace Facility. As members of the Council, we have
constructively engaged to address the African Union‚Äôs
concerns and AMISOM‚Äôs needs. It is in this same
constructive spirit that we have once more voted in
favour of strengthening the African Union Mission in
Somalia.
We feel nevertheless that it is important to bear in
mind, as the Secretary-General acknowledges in his
latest report on Somalia (S/2012/74), the current
environment of global financial constraint, to which
the United Nations peacekeeping budget is not
immune. Hence, it is imperative to seek additional
funding for AMISOM and to broaden its international
donor base. The forthcoming London conference
should be instrumental in that regard. Moreover, the
additional efforts that we are all willing to make at the
security and military levels ‚Äî and in that regard allow
me to commend the hard work and sacrifices of
S/PV.6718
12-237864
AMISOM‚Äôs regional partners and of the Somali
security forces ‚Äî should be accompanied by a serious
commitment on the part of the Somali political leaders
to the political process.
Portugal takes note of the recent agreement of the
second set of Garowe Principles on federalism, system
of Government and ending the transition by
operationalizing the first set of Garowe Principles, and
we take this opportunity to urge the Transitional
Federal Institutions and all road map signatories to
redouble their efforts. Turning those decisions into
reality is another significant step that the Somalis
themselves need to take towards a stable and viable
State that will pave the way for a better future for the
Somali people.
Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): The African
Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is today the
mainstay of the efforts of the international community
to stabilize the security situation in Somalia. We
strongly commend the countries contributing troops to
AMISOM for their commitment to the Mission and for
the sacrifices their men have made.
Despite its limited resources, AMISOM has made
significant achievements in the implementation of its
mandate over the past year. The Mission therefore
deserves more support from the international
community. In that connection, we welcome
AMISOM‚Äôs new strategic concept, developed jointly
by the African Union and the United Nations. We think
that the full implementation of that concept has the
potential to accelerate the stabilization of the security
situation in Somalia. That, in turn, will facilitate
political stabilization and also improve the socio-
economic and humanitarian situations.
We voted in favour of resolution 2036 (2012)
today because it strengthens AMISOM and provides it
with more predictable and sustainable resources,
including force enablers and multipliers. We are
disappointed, however, that the resolution does not
include naval assets for contingent-owned equipment
reimbursement. We are of the view that the proposed
maritime component of AMISOM, limited as it is, is
integral to the new strategic concept and thus to the
success of the Mission. The pacification of the Somali
coastline is essential not only to depriving Al-Shabaab
of port revenues and export earnings, but also to
dealing with the ever-increasing menace of piracy and
hostage-taking. We therefore expect that the Council
will address this shortcoming when it next considers
AMISOM‚Äôs mandate.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): South Africa
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2036 (2012) on
enhancing the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM). The resolution comes at a critical stage
when the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia
continues to make significant progress in the
implementation of the road map, as witnessed at the
Garowe conferences. The security situation in Somalia
has also witnessed a marked improvement, with
AMISOM patrolling almost 90 per cent of Mogadishu.
Despite all the positive developments, we are not
oblivious to the many challenges still besetting the
country at the political, security and humanitarian
levels.
The resolution just adopted offers a significant
improvement in the logistical support package
provided to AMISOM and increases the troop level
from 12,000 to 17,731. As the recent report of the
Secretary-General states, the revised African Union-
United Nations joint strategic concept of the for
AMISOM ‚Äúrepresents the most pragmatic way forward,
in view of the prevailing circumstances on the ground,
even though confronted with risks and challenges‚Äù
(S/2012/74, para. 43).
We are therefore concerned that not all of the
proposals of the Secretary-General and the African
Union have been taken into account. Full support for
the strategic concept is necessary to the effective
implementation of AMISOM‚Äôs operations. We also
regret that the hurried manner in which the text of the
resolution was negotiated has compelled us to adopt a
resolution that does not take into account all of our
concerns. For example, the resolution makes no
mention of the essential maritime component, and does
not explicitly mention the intention of rehatting
AMISOM once conditions allow. We hope that these
issues will be addressed through bilateral and
multilateral support, including uncaveated contributions
of support to the AMISOM Trust Fund and in future
resolutions.
We look forward to the London conference to be
held tomorrow, which we hope will garner a unified
international response to the political, security and
humanitarian challenges confronting Somalia. This
should be an opportunity to consolidate existing
measures and efforts to resolve the Somali crisis. We
S/PV.6718
512-23786
encourage greater strategic coherence between the
United Nations and the African Union, in line with
resolution 2033 (2012).
Finally, South Africa believes that the only
sustainable resolution of the Somali crisis is through an
all-inclusive Somali-led dialogue and consultation
process in line with the Djibouti Agreement.
Mr. Wittig (Germany): Germany has always been
supportive of the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM) and its troop contributors. We commend
the Mission, which operates under very difficult
circumstances and has sacrificed and achieved a lot. It
is the determination and commitment of these African
Union forces that have improved the security situation
on the ground in the past months. We will continue to
provide support to AMISOM in the framework of the
United Nations, the European Union and bilaterally.
Furthermore, my country actively engages in the
European Union training mission for Somali security
forces and international efforts to combat piracy off
Somalia‚Äôs coast.
Resolution 2036 (2012) recognizes the support
provided to Somalia by bilateral partners and regional
organizations. I would like to recall once more the
substantial contributions made by the European Union,
currently and in the past, and I call on all States
members of the United Nations and regional
organizations, and especially those that have not
contributed so far, to join in these efforts. In adopting
resolution 2036 (2012) on the eve of the important
London conference, the Council has shown its
commitment to and ongoing support for AMISOM and
the Somali people. The members of the Council are
willing to seize the opportunity on the ground and to
enhance their support for the African Union in a
considerable manner.
As has been said before, all international efforts
will fail if the Somalis themselves fail to reconcile, to
move towards better governance, and to build new
Somali institutions that provide for peaceful and decent
lives for the Somali people. Therefore, in resolution
2036 (2012) we urgently call on the Somali actors to
comply with the road map and to speed up its
implementation. We call for the speedy establishment
of Somali security forces and administrative structures,
especially in those areas that have been secured by
AMISOM. Finally, we recall that action must be taken
against the spoilers of the peace process.
For Germany, the ultimate goal of all efforts
remains a united and functioning Somali State.
AMISOM cannot continue indefinitely. The current
situation calls for the establishment of security and of a
responsible and representative Somali Government that
promotes the political process and the delivery of basic
services to Somali citizens.
All of this requires a solid framework. The
adoption of a new, legitimate constitution would be a
very important step in this direction. Only such steps,
implemented by responsible Somali actors, can lay the
basis for a State in which AMISOM would be able to
leave after having successfully fulfilled its tasks.
Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): The
situation in Somalia is worrisome and demands the
international community‚Äôs priority attention. This is
why we voted in favour of resolution 2036 (2012)
today. We hope that it will contribute to the success of
African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). We pay
tribute to its personnel, who are carrying out a difficult
and critical task on the ground.
The adoption of resolution 2036 (2012) bears
witness to the commitment of the international
community and should lead Somalis to take up their
responsibilities so as to resolve the crisis in their
country. That will require the development of a sound
political strategy and effective administration in the
liberated zones of the country. We hope that the
London conference on Somalia will allow for progress
in that respect.
We must also encourage the development of the
Somali security forces. The European Union is making
significant contributions to that end and preparing to
strengthen its support to the maritime and legal
capacities of Somalia and the other countries of the
region. Others should contribute to that effort. Finally,
the Somali authorities must be fully committed to
combating piracy, including on the legal front.
I stress the importance of the financial support to
AMISOM that is provided by the European Union,
which is financing personnel to the tune of some
‚Ç¨130 million. Obviously, the European Union, whose
members already contribute more than 40 per cent of
the budgets of United Nations peacekeeping operations,
cannot alone assume the entire financial burden for the
implementation of the decision taken today by the
Council. That would be taxing the European Union
S/PV.6718
12-237866
twofold. We therefore call for new donors to commit
financially to the funding of AMISOM.
In conclusion, I recall the need for strategic
consideration of the future of peacekeeping operations
in general. Increasing troop levels alone cannot
guarantee the success of such missions. We must also
ensure that costs are controlled in an Organization
where five countries cover more than 60 per cent of the
budget of peacekeeping operations. In the context of a
global financial crisis, this is a limitation that the
Secretariat and all relevant players must take more
fully into account. We shall continue to accord great
attention to that issue.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.
