its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them

prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed to
me that they maintain their well-known positions vis-à-
vis the item on the Council’s agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, as President, with the consent of the
members of the Council, I have drawn the conclusion
that the Council can proceed to take a decision on the
draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,

The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1486 (2003).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
