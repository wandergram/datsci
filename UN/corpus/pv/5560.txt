Report of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2006/817)

The meeting was called to order at 11.35 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2006/817)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/817, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western
Sahara.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/850, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Russian
Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1720 (2006).
I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
Mr. Brencick (United States of America): The
United States has voted in favour of this resolution, but
with the understanding that all parties will use the next
six months to aggressively negotiate a mutually
acceptable solution that brings peace, stability and
economic prosperity to the region in a manner
consistent with the principle of self-determination for
the people of Western Sahara.
The United States remains concerned that the
Western Sahara conflict has impeded regional
integration and development for the past 30 years. A
lasting resolution is long overdue. Unresolved, this
humanitarian crisis leaves the Sahraoui people with a
bleak and uncertain future. Further deterioration has
the potential to worsen their hardship and could
threaten political and economic progress in Algeria and
Morocco as well.
While we cannot impose a solution, we can call
on all parties to engage the United Nations and each
other in a spirit of flexibility and compromise. In
particular, we urge Morocco to move quickly to fulfil
its many promises to submit a comprehensive and
credible autonomy proposal for the Western Sahara. We
also urge Morocco to engage seriously in discussions
with all Sahraoui people, including the Polisario. These
discussions, without a predetermined agenda, could
form the basis for a new, United Nations-led
negotiating process.
Our hope is based on the faith that all parties will
exert the leadership and willingness necessary to
improve their collective future and solve this dispute.
The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) is not a viable alternative
to a permanent solution, and we, therefore, call on
Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario to move beyond
rhetoric to the serious work needed for the resolution
of this conflict. In practical terms, we also call on the
Secretary-General to examine the mechanisms and
timetable for the dismantlement of MINURSO, should
MINURSO continue to prove ineffective in fulfilling
its mandate or the concerned parties prove unable to
make substantial progress towards a political solution.
Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
voted in favour of the additional extension for six
months of the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
The United Nations Secretary-General has underscored
the vital role of the presence of MINURSO for the
continued ceasefire in Western Sahara.
France would once again state its wish that the
next few months should be used profitably to break the
impasse. No one can be happy about this impasse, and
there is a need to establish a mutually acceptable
S/PV.5560
306-59410
political agreement within the United Nations
framework.
France has noted with interest the intention of the
Kingdom of Morocco, noted in the report of the
Secretary-General, to present some proposals over the
next few months. This is an encouraging development
that, we hope, will make it possible to move forward.
France, once again, would reaffirm its support for
the activities of the Secretary-General and the work of
his Personal Envoy.
Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom has voted in favour of the resolution adopted
by the Council to renew the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) for a further six months. As the resolution
was a technical roll-over of the mandate, I would like
to set out aspects of the situation that the United
Kingdom considers to be important.
Firstly, the United Kingdom thanks the United
Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy,
Mr. van Walsum, for their efforts to find a way forward
in this dispute.
The United Kingdom noted references in the
report of the Secretary-General about the human rights
situation. The United Kingdom believes we should
continue to monitor the protection of human rights in
the region, while working to move beyond the current
impasse.
MINURSO has continued to play a stabilizing
role in the region. However, no United Nations
peacekeeping mandate should be regarded as open-
ended. After the renewal of MINURSO’s mandate in
April of this year, we had hoped that there would be
steps forward on this issue and that we would not
require a purely technical roll-over at this meeting.
I would like to reiterate the United Kingdom’s
desire to see progress in the next six months, beyond
the current impasse.
I would like to underline again the United
Kingdom’s position that the only solution to this issue
has to be mutually acceptable and provide for the self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara, in line
with United Nations requirements as set out in
previous Security Council resolutions.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.
