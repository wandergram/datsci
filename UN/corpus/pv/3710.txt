The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the

the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr.
Nsanze (Burundi), Mr. Ubalijoro (Rwanda) and Mr.
Lukabu Khabouji N’Zaji (Zaire) took seats at the
Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the letter
dated 7 November 1996 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council,
document S/1996/916.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1996/921, which contains the text of a draft

consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: document

interim of the Permanent Mission of Zaire to the United

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
