The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to

the Congo.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2007/694, which contains a letter dated
30 November 2007 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to

The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15

unanimously as resolution 1797 (2008).
Following consultations among the members of
the Security Council, I have been authorized to make
the following statement on behalf of the Council:
‚ÄúThe Security Council congratulates
President Kabila and the Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the
organizers of and participants in the Conference
for Peace, Security and Development in North and
South Kivu, on the success of the Conference,
held in Goma from 6 to 23 January 2008.
‚ÄúThe Security Council is particularly
pleased that the armed groups in North and South
Kivu have undertaken to observe a complete and
immediate ceasefire, to begin the withdrawal of
their forces with a view to their brassage or their
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
under the national programme for that process,
and to abide strictly by the rules of international
humanitarian and human rights law, set out in the
statements of commitment (Actes d‚Äôengagement)
which they signed with the Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo on 23 January
2008.
‚ÄúThe Council commends the Government
for ordering a ceasefire in accordance with the
statements of commitment. In the framework of
the fight against impunity, while noting the
Government‚Äôs pledge to seek parliamentary
S/PV.5828
308-22138
approval of an amnesty law covering acts of war
and insurrection, the Council welcomes the
exclusion of genocide, war crimes or crimes
against humanity from the scope of this amnesty.
‚ÄúThe Security Council urges all the parties
to the agreements to respect the ceasefire and to
implement the other commitments they have
undertaken effectively and in good faith. In this
connection, it emphasizes the importance of the
work to be carried out by the joint commissions
provided for in the statements of commitment,
and encourages the international community,
including the United Nations Organization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUC), to support that process. It also
encourages MONUC to support the
implementation of the statements of commitment,
within the limits of its capacity and in accordance
with its mandate, including with regard to the
protection of civilians.
‚ÄúThe Security Council also welcomes the
resolutions adopted at the Conference and calls
upon the appropriate authorities to act on the
recommendations addressed to them. It
underscores the need for the Congolese
authorities and all political and social
stakeholders in North and South Kivu to
continue, through dialogue, to seek long-term and
comprehensive ways to address the root causes of
instability.
‚ÄúThe Security Council reiterates the
importance of the commitments undertaken by
the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the Government of the Republic of
Rwanda in their joint communiqu√© on a common
approach to end the threat posed by illegal armed
groups in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to peace and stability in
both countries and the Great Lakes region, signed
in Nairobi on 9 November 2007 (S/2007/679). It
calls on the two Governments to continue to
implement fully the joint communiqu√©, in
particular by promptly taking appropriate
measures to induce the Forces d√©mocratiques de
lib√©ration du Rwanda (FDLR) and other foreign
armed groups to lay down their arms without
preconditions and return to their home countries.
‚ÄúThe Security Council encourages the
international community, in particular the eastern
neighbours of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in the Great Lakes region, to fully support
the new dynamic launched by the Goma
Conference and the Nairobi communiqu√©, which
together represent a major step towards the
restoration of lasting peace and stability in the
Great Lakes region.‚Äù
This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2008/2.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.
