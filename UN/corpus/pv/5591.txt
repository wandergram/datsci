The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Eleventh progress report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Operation in
Côte d’Ivoire (S/2006/939)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President,
Mr. Djangoné-Bi (Côte d’Ivoire) took a seat at
the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/939, which contains the eleventh
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/981, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian

unanimously as resolution 1726 (2006).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
