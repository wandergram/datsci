Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Letter dated 31 March 2006 from the
Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to
the United Nations addressed to the President of
the Security Council (S/2006/207)
Letter dated 15 June 2006 from the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2006/406)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Osode
(Liberia) and Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone) took
seats at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/405, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2006/207, containing a
letter dated 31 March 2006 from the Netherlands, and
document S/2006/406, containing a letter dated 15 June
2006 from the United Kingdom.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall now put the draft resolution
to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1688 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation shares the view of
members of the Security Council on the need to hold a
trial for former Liberian President Charles Taylor away
from the seat of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. We
note the constructive role played by the Governments
of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the
authorities at the International Criminal Court and the
States parties to the Court‚Äôs Statute in connection with
transferring the trial to The Hague.
At the same time, we would like to inform the
members of the Council about how we understand the
resolution that has just been adopted.
The Russian Federation believes that, for the
purposes of this resolution, action under Chapter VII of
the Charter is unique and exceptional in nature, and
does not set a precedent for resolving similar issues in
the same way.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
