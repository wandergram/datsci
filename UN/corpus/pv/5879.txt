The President: I should like to inform the

and rule 37 of the Council’s provision rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mohamed

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
