The President: I should like to inform the

representative of Timor-Leste, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres

and on justice and reconciliation for Timor-Leste,
respectively.
