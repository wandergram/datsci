The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation in Afghanistan and its implications for
international peace and security (S/2008/159)
The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Tanin
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/185, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/2008/159, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Afghanistan and its implications for international peace
and security.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1806 (2008).
I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Spatafora (Italy): I wish to briefly take the
floor in order to thank all delegations for their very
constructive, flexible and strong support during the
consultations on this resolution, as well as to express
our full satisfaction with the outcome. Once again, the
Council is rallying strongly and united behind one of
the most important missions of the United Nations.
We are convinced that this text meets all the
expectations expressed in the report (S/2008/159) of
the Secretary-General and in the briefing by Under-
Secretary-General Gu√©henno on 12 March. The
Secretary-General recommended that the Mission‚Äôs
mandate be sharpened. Indeed, the resolution was
conceived and discussed in that spirit. In fact, not only
are we extending the mandate of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for a
further 12 months, we are also offering the Mission
clear guidance on the priorities to take forward within
the mandate in the coming months: enhanced
coordination of, and leadership on, international
efforts; strengthened cooperation with the International
Security Assistance Force; political outreach; national
reconciliation; governance; humanitarian assistance;
the promotion of human rights; elections; and regional
cooperation.
The resolution also highlights what we have
perceived as the main feature of the 12 March debate:
the need for all the activities of the Mission and of the
international community at large to be guided by the
overarching principle of reinforcing Afghan ownership
and leadership.
Finally, we are pleased with the focus of the
United Nations on some crucial horizontal issues,
namely, the protection of civilians, children and armed
conflict, women and peace and security. It is now the
duty of the entire international community to translate
the resolution into concrete support for UNAMA, in
particular for the efforts of the newly appointed Special
S/PV.5857
308-27820
Representative of the Secretary-General. I am
confident that he will receive from all Member States
and from the Headquarters of the United Nations the
necessary resources and political support to fulfil his
daunting task.
The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
