The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2000/496 and
corrigendum 1.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/549, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
I have also received letters from the Permanent
Representatives of Greece and of the Republic of
Cyprus, from the Deputy Permanent Representative of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, and from the Permanent Representative of
Turkey. This last contains an annex setting out the
position of the Turkish Cypriot side.
Members of the Council have been informed of
the content of these letters.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2000/549)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1303 (2000).
I believe I can say that all members of the
Council very sincerely wish for the success of the
forthcoming proximity talks, which will be held in
Geneva beginning on 5 July.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
