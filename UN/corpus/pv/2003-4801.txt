The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2003/565 and Corr.1)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation
concerning Western Sahara, document S/2003/565 and
Corr.1. Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/777, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1495 (2003).
I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
Mr. Boubacar Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in
French): My delegation would like to express its
satisfaction at the unanimous adoption of resolution
1495 (2003) on the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which
reaffirms, if there were need to do so, the shared
concern of the Council to preserve its unity and
credibility.
The compromise that we have achieved following
difficult negotiations opens the way to a new and
dynamic process that will allow the parties involved to
engage in negotiations designed to achieve a just,
lasting and mutually acceptable solution to the question
of the Western Sahara. It is also a sign of the
continuation of constructive dialogue aimed at
achieving a political solution, which clearly will assist
in peace-building and in consolidating solidarity
throughout the Maghreb region.
The second operative paragraph, which calls on
the parties to work with the United Nations and with
each other towards acceptance and implementation of
the Peace plan, fits into that dynamic process.
Once again, we would like to reiterate our sincere
gratitude to the Secretary-General and to his Personal
Envoy, Mr. James Baker, for their tireless efforts to
find a solution to this question. We encourage them to
continue in their lofty task.
Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council traditionally decides by consensus on
the issue of Western Sahara. This is a critically
important and decisive element that endows the action
of the United Nations with full force in helping the
parties find a just and lasting solution to this dispute.
Following sometimes arduous negotiations, the
French delegation welcomes the fact that consensus
was maintained in the adoption of the draft resolution
submitted today. That resolution makes clear the fact
that the Security Council is not deviating from the
approach it has been taking in dealing with the issue of
Western Sahara, which seems to us the best way of
making progress towards a lasting settlement.
Indeed, this resolution does not impose a solution
on the parties, which would have been likely to cause
the dynamic process of dialogue and efforts towards
peace to break down. Rather, it prompts a resumption
of discussions, backed by the confidence of the
Council.
The Secretary-General had noted in June 2001 the
deadlock regarding the peace plan. Other ideas had to
be found that would make it possible to achieve
progress towards a equitable solution to the dispute. In
this context, we commend Mr. Baker‚Äôs efforts to come
up with imaginative options and to provide fresh
3
S/PV.4801
impetus to the quest for a political solution agreed on
by the parties. It is this track that must be pursued.
Mr. Raytchev (Bulgaria): Bulgaria welcomes the
fact that it was possible to reach a consensus on the
proposed text for the resolution just adopted. We would
like to express our deep conviction that, on the basis of
the resolution, both parties will work towards a
mutually acceptable solution.
I wish also to take this opportunity to express our
appreciation to the Secretary-General and to his
Personal Envoy for their tireless efforts to find a
solution to the problem.
Mr. Khalid (Pakistan): Our position on the
question of Western Sahara is well known. Pakistan
attaches great importance to this issue and its early
resolution, involving, as it does, countries with which
Pakistan enjoys traditionally close and fraternal
relations.
The Western Sahara issue has long been on the
agenda of the Security Council and hinges on the
principle of self-determination, which is an integral
part of the Charter of the United Nations. Pakistan
appreciates the continued engagement of the Secretary-
General and the significant role played by his Envoy,
Mr. James Baker, in pursuit of a political solution to
the dispute over Western Sahara which provides for the
realization of the right to self-determination.
The peace plan could provide a basis to facilitate
the early solution of this issue on the basis of
agreement between the two parties. Pakistan supports a
negotiated peaceful settlement, in accordance with the
relevant Security Council resolutions. Pakistan has
consistently held that all resolutions of the Security
Council, whether under Chapter VI or Chapter VII,
should be implemented.
Pakistan has all along supported the efforts aimed
at finding a common ground, with a view to bringing
the parties closer to a solution. We therefore appreciate
the constructive efforts made by the members of the
Council to evolve an acceptable text. We are glad that
the Council has been able to move forward in a unified
way.
Pakistan has joined this consensus in the hope
that this resolution represents a step forward in the
direction of a peaceful settlement of this longstanding
dispute.
Mr. Chungong Ayafor (Cameroon) (spoke in
French): My delegation welcomes the recent adoption
by consensus of the resolution on Western Sahara. This
resolution ‚Äî the result of the efforts of all members of
the Council ‚Äî attests to its determination to find a just,
lasting and mutually acceptable solution. The
flexibility and constructive spirit evinced by the parties
enabled the Council to achieve such a positive outcome
and to maintain its unity.
My country would like to congratulate the
Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for their
tireless efforts and persistence in the pursuit of a
solution for Western Sahara. Cameroon reiterates its
faith in a negotiated solution accepted by all parties
and assures the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy of its support.
My delegation urges the parties to engage in
direct, frank and constructive dialogue with a view to
resolving their differences. We believe that this is the
only way to restore peace and cooperation in the
Maghreb in particular and in Africa in general.
Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): The
resolution we have adopted today responds to the
Secretary-General‚Äôs recommendations on the way
ahead in the Western Sahara. This resolution represents
a considered recommendation of the Council to the
parties and neighbouring States but does not constitute
an imposition. All Council members support the peace
plan for the self-determination of the people of Western
Sahara as an optimum political solution to this long-
standing dispute of nearly 30 years.
The peace plan is a fair and balanced compromise
giving each party some, but not all, of what it wants.
We call on the parties and the neighbouring States to
seize the opportunity presented by the plan and to
cooperate closely and actively with the Secretary-
General and his Personal Envoy, and with each other,
to follow up this important resolution. We especially
appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General‚Äôs
Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, in achieving this
important step forward towards resolution of the long-
standing Western Sahara dispute.
Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation has always believed that the
authority of the Security Council stems from its unity.
We are therefore pleased to note that, in the spirit of
compromise and cooperation, and after numerous
consultations, we have finally adopted the present
resolution on Western Sahara. That once again proves
that, with sufficient political will, consensus is always
attainable. We hope that the spirit of consensus will
continue to prevail in our work.

S/PV.4801
China has always been concerned about the issue
of Western Sahara. It has been our hope that this matter
could be resolved in a fair and equitable way, within
the framework of the United Nations.
China supports and appreciates the efforts made
by the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy,
Mr. James Baker. We also wish to thank all the parties
concerned for their tireless efforts to find a solution to
this problem. We hope that that the parties concerned
will continue to act in the spirit of pragmatism. We also
hope that this long-standing problem can be resolved as
soon as possible through dialogue and consultation, for
the sake of peace and development in the Maghreb
region.
Mr. Mu√±oz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We have
this morning adopted a resolution on the question of
Western Sahara based on consensus ‚Äî rather than
imposition ‚Äî regarding what we hope will be a real
path towards a definitive resolution of the conflict in
Western Sahara. We now have a clear and pragmatic
resolution that leaves enough political room to reach a
definitive solution on the basis of the Baker plan and
the agreement of the parties. We are pleased with that
important step, which does the Security Council credit.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank
the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy. We hope
that the parties will now do their part. In the end, it is
the parties themselves who hold in their hands a chance
to reach a definitive solution that brings about peace
and stability and that responds to the aspirations of the
peoples.
Mr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):
The Security Council has reached consensus on a
resolution regarding Western Sahara, an item that has
been on the Council‚Äôs agenda for a very long time
without agreement among the parties on a settlement.
Having cast a positive vote, my delegation would like
to reiterate what we believe to be the two main
principles governing United Nations actions in
reaching a solution to this long-standing problem.
First, there is the principle of self-determination,
which must not be abandoned as an essential element
in pursuit of a just resolution of this issue. The second
is the fact that the parties and the international
community have opted for a negotiated solution. The
job of the Council, the Secretary-General and his
Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, is to explore every
avenue potentially conducive to a negotiated
settlement.
Today‚Äôs resolution constitutes progress on both
those counts, in that it reaffirms the principle of self-
determination and seeks a negotiated settlement.
Possible elements of agreement can be discerned in
that progress. The Council has expressed its view that
the Baker plan has obvious merit and my delegation
shares that view. The resolution very clearly and
justifiably points that out. Although there is not yet
complete agreement among all the parties on that
proposal, we nevertheless believe that the plan should
be the conceptual and substantial basis to ensure that
the mediation sponsored by the Secretary-General and
being carried out by Mr. Baker can now make progress
towards agreement.
We are convinced that there is now a new
opportunity to achieve a lasting solution to this
problem.
Mr. Pleuger (Germany): I have the feeling that
everything has already been said, but not yet by
everybody.
I would like to join other delegations in
commending the work done by the Secretary-General
and his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, in preparing
this resolution. We welcome the fact that the Security
Council has reached consensus on the resolution. We
feel that it is now a fair basis for negotiations in good
faith. We call upon the parties, neighbouring States and
the Secretary-General ‚Äî acting through his Personal
Envoy ‚Äî to work together to use this opportunity to
come closer to a fair and negotiated settlement of this
long-standing conflict.
Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Like my
colleague from Germany, I too would like to join other
colleagues in commending the President personally for
enabling these difficult negotiations to produce
something that is good for the parties and that can
make it possible for us to uphold the recommendations
of the Secretary-General‚Äôs Personal Envoy ‚Äî the
Baker plan ‚Äî and of the Secretary-General. I think
that, after so many years, we now have a good basis
upon which the parties and the countries of the region
can together build a sound country in Western Sahara. I
would also like to say that the principle of self-
determination has been kept as the basic principle for
negotiation. That is very positive.
I would like to commend the parties for the
political will they have demonstrated. I hope that this
will be maintained down the road, as the road map that
now exists constitutes a very sound basis upon which
they can build together. They can count on the support
5
S/PV.4801
of the international community. I also wish to say that
we in Angola would like to be able to build upon the
relations that already exist among all the countries in
the region that are party to this arrangement.
Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): We too would like to express our satisfaction
with the decision that has been taken by the Security
Council. It is important that the resolution that has
been adopted opens up the way for the continuation of
the peace process on the basis of Mr. James Baker‚Äôs
peace plan. At the same time, it does not impose a final
solution to the problem upon the sides. That solution
will be worked out jointly in the negotiating process
among the parties and the United Nations.
We also consider it very significant that the
Security Council has been able to demonstrate its
capacity to come to an important consensus decision on
a difficult problem on its agenda.
Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in
Arabic): My delegation welcomes the adoption by
consensus of the draft resolution on the Western
Sahara. Any lack of agreement between Arab parties is
of great concern to Syria. Syria always makes every
possible effort to resolve differences between Arab
parties. We hope that the consensus resolution that we
have adopted will bring the parties together with a
view to achieving a peaceful resolution of the question
of Western Sahara.
We would like to thank the Secretary-General and
express appreciation for his efforts and those of his
Personal Envoy. We wish them every success in their
endeavours in the near future.
The President (spoke in Spanish): I will now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Spain.
The unanimous adoption of resolution 1495
(2003) clearly represents an important step towards a
just, lasting and mutually acceptable settlement of this
controversy. It is of particular importance for the
countries in the region and for the Mahgreb in general.
Spain has always had a policy of constructive
neutrality and of not imposing solutions on the parties.
We have spared no effort, as an interested party to the
conflict as well as in our capacity as President of the
Council, to achieve the greatest possible consensus.
We believe that, under current circumstances, the
Council could not have limited itself to approving a
mere technical extension. The Council had before it the
serious and concrete proposal of Mr. Baker, the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General ‚Äî a proposal
recommended by the Secretary-General ‚Äî and it was
duty-bound to express its views on it. Furthermore, in
giving positive consideration to the proposal, the
Council could not waste the opportunity that this
provided the parties to make a commitment based upon
mutual agreement.
Spain would like to express its satisfaction at this
outcome ‚Äî which coincides with our position ‚Äî
particularly since it deals with a dispute, and, therefore,
the Security Council must deal with the issue under
Chapter VI of the Charter. Given that a resolution of
the dispute must be based on agreement among the
parties, we are also pleased that that is indicated in
both the preambular and operative parts of the
resolution.
Furthermore, the resolution deals with other
important objectives of the Council. It supports the
Personal Envoy‚Äôs peace plan, considering it the best
chance for a solution, and calls upon the parties to the
conflict to cooperate with the United Nations and
among themselves with a view to accepting and
implementing the peace plan.
I would like to conclude by thanking all members
of the Security Council for their understanding, as well
as for the efforts that they made in the course of
drafting. We would like in particular to thank the
United States delegation ‚Äî Ambassador Negroponte
and his team ‚Äî for their ability to combine the
determination to make real progress with the necessary
flexibility to include contributions from Council
members, including my own.
In conclusion, Spain would like to reiterate the
appeal that has been addressed to the parties not to
waste this opportunity and to begin, with the least
delay, a dialogue leading to the full acceptance of the
plan and the implementation of its provisions on the
basis of mutual agreement. Spain reaffirms its support
for such a dialogue. We will do our utmost to ensure
that it can become a reality in the near future.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
