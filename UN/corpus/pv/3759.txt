The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Angola, in which she requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to

accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Coelho Da Cruz

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola

resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/1997/262)
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
