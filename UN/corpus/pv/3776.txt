The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany and Italy, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey
