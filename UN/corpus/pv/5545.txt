Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of October, I should
like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Adamantios
Vassilakis, Permanent Representative of Greece, for his
service as President of the Security Council for the
month of September 2006. I am sure I speak for all
members of the Council in expressing deep
appreciation to Ambassador Vassilakis for the great
diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council’s
business last month.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
