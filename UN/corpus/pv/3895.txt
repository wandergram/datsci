Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation between Eritrea and Ethiopia
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Eritrea and Ethiopia, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Menkerios
(Eritrea) and Mr. Mohammed (Ethiopia) took seats at
the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1998/572, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: letters from
Eritrea, contained in documents S/1998/459, S/1998/478,
S/1998/482, S/1998/483, S/1998/492, S/1998/499,
S/1998/505, S/1998/508, S/1998/536, S/1998/541 and
S/1998/556; letters from Ethiopia, contained in documents
S/1998/467, S/1998/471, S/1998/490, S/1998/493,

letters from Zimbabwe, contained in documents
S/1998/465 and S/1998/485; letters from Kenya, contained
in documents S/1998/480 and S/1998/494; letter from the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
contained in document S/1998/495; letter from Rwanda
and the United States of America, contained in document
S/1998/496; and letter from Burkina Faso, contained in
document S/1998/555.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1998/572) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
