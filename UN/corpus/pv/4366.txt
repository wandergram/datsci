Security Council resolution 1160 (1998) of
31 March 1998
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to the United Nations, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Šahović
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) took a seat at
the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/849, which contains the text of a
letter dated 6 September 2001 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council. Members of the Council also have before
them document S/2001/854, which contains the text of
a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2001/854)
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
