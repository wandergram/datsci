The meeting was called to order at 10.50 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (S/2003/728)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, document S/2003/728.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/778, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France.
I should also like to draw attention to the
following other documents: S/2003/603 and
S/2003/758, letters dated 2 June and 24 July 2003,
respectively, from the Permanent Representative of
Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-
General; and S/2003/685 and S/2003/698, letters dated
2 July and 9 July 2003, respectively, from the Charg√©
d‚Äôaffaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to
the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2003/778) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1496 (2003).
Before we adjourn, I should like warmly to thank
the members of the Secretariat for their effective
support to the presidency, for which I am most grateful.
I should like also to thank all members of the Council
for the unfailing support they provided the Spanish
presidency, which made it possible for us to carry out
interesting work on behalf of the Security Council and
of the United Nations. This work fills me with
satisfaction and has made me famous in the
international media, particularly among my own
people.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.55 a.m.
