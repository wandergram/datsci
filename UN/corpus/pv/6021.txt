The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Letter dated 13 November 2008 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2008/705)
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Germany, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Čolaković
(Bosnia and Herzegovina) took a seat at the
Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/720, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, Croatia, France,
Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2008/705, which contains the
text of a letter dated 13 November 2008 from the
Secretary-General, transmitting the thirty-fourth report
on the implementation of the Peace Agreement on
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1845 (2008).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.
