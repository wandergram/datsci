Agenda
The situation in Angola
Security Council 3962nd meeting
Fifty-third year 31 December 1998
The meeting was called to order at 2.25 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Angola
The President (interpretation from Arabic): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Angola in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Van Dunem
“Mbinda” (Angola) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (interpretation from Arabic): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1998/1238, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution (S/1998/1238) before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bahrain, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, France, Gabon,
Gambia, Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Russian Federation,
Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President (interpretation from Arabic): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1219 (1998).
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
I wish to take this opportunity to wish everyone a
happy New Year.
The meeting rose at 2.35 p.m.
