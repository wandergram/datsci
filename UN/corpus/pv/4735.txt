The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Timor-Leste, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
Special report of the Secretary-General on the United

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/401, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to a letter dated 3 April 2003 from the
United Kingdom addressed to the President of the
Security Council, which has been issued as document
S/2003/379.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2003/401) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
