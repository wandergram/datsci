The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2012/197)
The President: Under rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Spain to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/249, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the Russian
Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
I also wish to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2012/197, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation
concerning Western Sahara.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2044 (2012).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): The adoption of
resolution 2044 (2012) comes at a time of uncertainty
and turmoil in the Sahel, North and West Africa and the
Middle East, when the peoples of those regions are
demanding the full enjoyment of their human, socio-
economic and political rights. It also comes at a time
when the States of the Mahgreb are moving towards
closer cooperation. It should be borne in mind that,
despite such transitions within the region, the issue of
Western Sahara still remains unchanged.
We appreciate the sustained efforts of the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Mr. Christopher Ross, towards finding a
negotiated and peaceful solution to the question of
Western Sahara. We welcome the fact that the parties
have made some progress during the negotiations,
especially on confidence-building measures. However,
I regret that the parties have not yet moved on the core
issue of realizing the objective of a just, lasting and
mutually acceptable political solution that provides for
the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara,
as required by Security Council resolutions.
We welcome the parties‚Äô stated commitment to
hold the next rounds of informal talks in June and July.
We ask them to focus on the core issues in order to
bring finality to that intractable dispute. We are also
pleased at the intention of the Personal Envoy to visit
the region, including an extensive visit to Western
Sahara for the first time.
We welcome the efforts of the Kingdom of
Morocco to advance the promotion and protection of
human rights in Morocco itself, including the
establishment of the National Council on Human
Rights. The visit of the Special Rapporteur on cultural
rights in September last year is welcome, and we
encourage Morocco to ensure unqualified and
unimpeded access to all special procedures of the
United Nations Human Rights Council.
The Council has taken bold steps in the past
18 months to protect the human rights of peoples,
particularly in North Africa and the Middle East. We
must ensure that those rights of the people of Western
Sahara are not ignored and that they too are defended
with the same zeal and commitment. We are thus
disappointed that, once again, the Security Council has
been unable to find agreement on establishing an
international, credible, legal and permanent human
rights mechanism within the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
It is an anomaly that MINURSO is one of the few
United Nations missions that does not have a human
rights mandate. Such a double standard creates the
S/PV.6758
312-30982
impression that the Security Council does not give
priority to the human rights of the people of Western
Sahara. The continuation of that trend has the potential
to erode the credibility of this important body. We see
no reason why the people of Western Sahara should be
treated any differently. The selective approach to
human rights by the Council calls into question the
motivation of those who have conveniently looked the
other way while human rights abuses are committed in
the territory of Western Sahara. The special procedures
of the Human Rights Council are an important element
in ensuring the protection of human rights. However,
they are not a substitute for a more permanent
mechanism.
We are concerned at the restriction placed on
MINURSO, particularly those measures that threaten to
compromise its neutrality. We call on all parties to
ensure that MINURSO is able to operate under
generally accepted peacekeeping principles, norms and
practices. We look forward to receiving a briefing and
report from the Secretary-General on the challenges to
MINURSO‚Äôs operations and steps taken to address
them.
South Africa reiterates the indisputable fact that
Western Sahara remains the last colony on the African
continent, listed as a Non-Self-Governing Territory by
the United Nations. South Africa will continue to
support efforts to achieve a just, lasting and mutually
acceptable political solution that will provide for the
self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. It
is for this reason that my delegation supported the
adoption of resolution 2044 (2012), extending the
mandate of MINURSO for another year.
The Security Council should continue to support
this process in an unbiased manner and ensure that
MINURSO is able to complete its mandate for three
critical purposes for which it was intended: first, as an
instrument of stability in the event that the political
stalemate should continue; secondly, as a mechanism to
implement a referendum on self-determination in the
event that political negotiations should be successful;
and thirdly, to provide independent information on
conditions in the Territory to the Secretariat, the
Security Council and the international community.
In concluding, I wish to raise my delegation‚Äôs
concern at the manner in which the report of the Secretary-
General (S/2012/197) was prepared and finalized. Due
consideration should be given to Article 100 of the
Charter of the United Nations in the preparation of
these reports.
Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic):
Morocco voted in favour of resolution 2044 (2012)
because it encourages the parties to accelerate the pace
of talks and calls on neighbouring States to strengthen
their participation in helping to advance progress
towards a realistic and negotiated political solution.
These are steps that we support and to which we
hereby commit ourselves.
We voted in favour of the resolution because it
reiterates the importance and priority of the self-
determination initiative launched by Morocco and
welcomes the efforts made by my country since 2006.
We are pleased to see the establishment of this
negotiating framework. Morocco voted in favour of the
resolution also because it reiterates the importance of
registering the Tindouf refugees. This is a matter of
relevance to our brothers in Algeria, given the presence
of refugees in their country and their obligations under
international humanitarian law with respect to those
refugees.
The resolution is proof that the Council is
mindful of our good faith and of the need to pursue
efforts in Laayoune and Dakhla that have been
affirmed by the National Council of Human Rights. It
is also evidence of our commitment, reiterated by the
Security Council through the resolution. The
importance of the resolution will not be diminished by
the doubts we heard expressed earlier. Our efforts fall
in the natural context of reform undertaken by His
Majesty King Mohammed VI, and have been given
new momentum by the new Constitution and the
transparent legislative elections that brought in a new
Government.
Morocco voted in favour of the resolution
because the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is very
important and appropriate in the context of the
Organization‚Äôs efforts. The mandate is now confined to
pursuing a ceasefire, closely monitoring negotiations
and facilitating confidence-building measures. These
highly important functions strengthen regional stability
and promote contact among the inhabitants of the Arab
Maghreb through the efforts of Mr. Christopher Ross.
The Council was quite right to refuse, for the
third year in a row, to consider broadening the mandate
to include matters that are irrelevant to the functions
S/PV.6758
12-309824
and nature of the Mission. We therefore believe that, in
adhering to the original mandate, the Council is
directing MINURSO to commit to the existing
agreements. We voted in favour of the resolution
because we are mindful that there is no alternative to
negotiations and that there is no turning back. The
approaches of the past cannot be revived today.
Since 2001, we have been convinced that the
referendum approach could result in disharmony and
tension in a society of coexistence that continues to
seek consensus solutions. We have therefore adopted
the approach of negotiation, which we have reactivated
in recent years. In order to entrench that trend, we have
adopted a realistic approach that derives its legitimacy
from the most successful and democratic models. That
is why the Security Council trusts that our efforts are
earnest, honest and conducive to progress in the
negotiating process.
Morocco is committed to these negotiations,
aware that the Western Sahara is Moroccan and that
Morocco must continue to exercise its sovereignty
there. Morocco endured colonization in the early
twentieth century and suffered greatly in seeking to
maintain its own territorial integrity. We are committed
to negotiations in order to preserve the stability of the
Arab Maghreb, strengthen good-neighbourly relations
among the States of the Maghreb, and create
momentum that will allow us to transcend our
differences and reinforce our common Arab dimension.
The desire to live as good neighbours in our own
neighbourhood will help us to resolve this conflict
through joint efforts to establish a climate of stability
in the Western Sahara.
We hope that today‚Äôs resolution will bolster
efforts to reach an agreement on the major issues and
to achieve the realistic solution sought by all in the
Maghreb, the Tindouf camps and the other Arab
Maghreb States. I know that all members of the
Council seek the same goal.
The President: There are no more speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
